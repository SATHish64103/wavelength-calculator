This is a MATLAB application which calculates wavelength of sound for given frequency(Hz).
The velocity of the sound depends on the medium it travels. By default the value set at 343 meters/sec (velocity of sound in air, 20Â°C).
The user can able edit the velocity of sound value depend on their need.

The application created using app designer in MATLAB r2018b. Please check requirements on MATLAB website before installing the app.
