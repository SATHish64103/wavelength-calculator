This MATLAB application calculates the wavelength of sound for a given frequency(Hz).
The velocity of sound depends on the medium through which it travels. By default, the value is set at 343 meters/sec, representing the velocity of sound in air, 20Â°C). However, users can edit this value according to their specific requirements.

The application was created using an app designer in MATLAB r2018b. Please check the requirements on the MATLAB website before running the code.
